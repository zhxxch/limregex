# limregex
A DFA-based regular expression prototype implementation
    -----**WITHOUT submatch extraction**.

Supports only * | ( ) ? . \d \D \w \W \s \S.
Support backslash"\" and "\xHH" escapes.
Support UTF-8 and could be configured to support other encodings.

**NO support for + ,**
     + and \+ both will match character '+'.
**NO support for character classes,**
     '[', ']' will be regarded as normal character.
**NO support for counted repetition,**
     '{', '}' will be regarded as normal character.
**NO support for backreference.**

## Demo:
        unsigned int match_length, code[50];
        /*  compile */
        limregexcl(code, 50, "hs|(s|hh)");
        /*  match   */
        match_length = limregexec("sssssh", code);
